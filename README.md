# JavaScript Songs Gallery with Promises

A simple JavaScript app, that I was create while I was learning JavaScript promises.

The initial task: [Songs Lyrics](https://wwwcourses.github.io/ProgressBG-JS-Advanced-React-Slides/pages/themes/AJAX/AJAX.html#/11/1).

The current implementation provides much more functionalities - it fetch dynamically: **1)** The collection of the favorite songs in JSON format; **2)** then for each song, when it comes time to play it fetch: **2.1)** the album cover, **2.2)** the lyrics of the song and **2.3)** the song itself in `ogg` format as `blob`.
