Controlled minds
Lead the blind
You cannot control mine
You'll never control mine
The question is for you
The youth
What will you do
With all this proof
The information's all there
Educate yourself if you dare

You want the truth
You want the truth
Rev up
Rev up
You want the truth
It's within you
Rev up
Rev up

Keep looking searching
See what you find
Don't fall for nothing
Don't fall in line
Use your own mind
To change their old minds

You want the truth
You want the truth
Rev up
Rev up
You want the truth
It's within you
Rev up
Rev up

Don't cut the root
But we need evolution
These troubled youth
Need a solution
Most of you
Suffer from delusion
You want the truth
Start a revolution

Yeah yeah
Start a revolution

Start a revolution

Don't cut the root
But we need evolution
These troubled youth
Need a solution
Most of you
Suffer from delusion
You want the truth
Start a revolution
