Give me sugar
Give me something sweet
I've spent a lifetime
Feeling incomplete
If I sound bitter
Or if I've come too late
Please reconsider
I don't need much on my plate
Just give me sugar

Don't come close, please keep at a distance
Look but don't touch till the light goes on
Sour as a lemon please wait at the window
Don't touch the glass till the curtain calls

Wait, wait... don't make me wait
Wait, wait... don't make me wait
Just give me sugar

Give me sugar
Give me something deep
Don't make a habit
Of crawling on my knees
But this is different
Can't you see I'm in control
This is the moment
Where all your dreams have flown
Just give me sugar

Don't come close, please keep at a distance
Look but don't touch till the light goes on
Sour as a lemon please wait at the window
Don't touch the glass till the curtain calls

Wait, wait... don't make me wait
Wait, wait... don't make me wait
Just give me sugar

To hook her on
Sugar to hook her on
Some sugar to hook her on
Sugar to hook her on

Oh won't someone love me
Won't someone love me
Won't someone love me
Oh won't someone love me
Like you (Sugar)... 
Someone like you
